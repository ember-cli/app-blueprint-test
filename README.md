# app-blueprint-test

This is an example repository (used by ember-cli's own test suite) 
that demonstrates how to provide a blueprint for use with the 
`--blueprint` command line argument.


## NPM

You can use blueprints that are published to NPM (with the `ember-blueprint` keyword).
To use a blueprint like this you would run the following command:

```
ember new some-good-name-here --blueprint=ember-blueprint-demo
```

## Git

To use a blueprint like this you would run the following command:

```
ember new some-good-name-here --blueprint=https://github.com/ember-cli/app-blueprint-test.git
```
